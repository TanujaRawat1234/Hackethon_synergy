CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT
-------------------------------------

Overall Risk: HIGH ⚠️

Risk Factors Present:
⚠️ Total cholesterol significantly elevated
⚠️ LDL cholesterol high
⚠️ HDL cholesterol low (protective factor reduced)
⚠️ Triglycerides borderline high
⚠️ Poor cholesterol ratios

IMMEDIATE CONCERNS:
• Increased risk of heart disease
• Increased risk of stroke
• Atherosclerosis risk
• Metabolic syndrome indicators

-------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------------------

URGENT ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. MEDICATION:
   ⚠️ Statin therapy recommended
   ⚠️ Consult cardiologist immediately

2. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS (CRITICAL):
   - DIET: Strict low-fat, low-cholesterol diet
     * Eliminate trans fats completely
     * Reduce saturated fats to <7% of calories
     * Increase soluble fiber to 10-25g/day
     * Add plant sterols/stanols
   
   - EXERCISE: Mandatory
     * 45-60 minutes daily
     * Combination of cardio and strength training
   
   - WEIGHT LOSS: If overweight
     * Target: 10% body weight reduction
   
   - SMOKING: Quit immediately if applicable
   
   - ALCOHOL: Limit or eliminate

3. MONITORING:
   - Retest lipid profile in 6-8 weeks after starting treatment
   - Monthly follow-ups with cardiologist
   - Home monitoring of blood pressure

4. ADDITIONAL TESTS RECOMMENDED:
   - Cardiac stress test
   - Carotid ultrasound
   - Blood pressure monitoring
   - Diabetes screening (HbA1c)

PROGNOSIS:
With aggressive treatment and lifestyle changes, 
significant improvement expected within 3-6 months.
